!http://thebebel.com/themeforest/description/descriptionfinal.jpg!

No matter if you throw a party, create an event for friends or colleagues - Event Guestlist Theme for WordPress makes it fun and easy to plan and promote your event!

*The Facts:*
* *Create Events* <br />
* *Sell Tickets via Paypal* <br />
* *Collect names and Email Adresses for your newsletter* <br />
* *Paypal Payment Gateway Included! * it works out of the box! <br /> (The PayPal feature is disabled in the preview)<br />
* *Connect your page to your mailchimp account!* <br />
* *Free html Email Templates included* <br />
	*and we even made it work with Mailchimp
	*edit the event template right in your backend, the mailchimp template right in the mailchimp builder! 
* *Gorgeous Fullscreen Background Slider <br />
* Easily add a stunning contact and blog page <br />
* *8 Color Styles*  - easily switch styles in the backend <br />
* *Translation ready with pot file.*  <br />
* Based on our next generation framework with more than *10.000* lines of (php) code <br />

*The Long Way*


It's as easy as creating a post. Enter a date, the location and some more information and the theme will create an *amazingly good looking* event page for you. It will include a *signup form*, you can create a *stunning fullscreen background slideshow* with a few clicks, and even let your users sign up for your *amazing newsletter*!
You will find no other theme that made these things that simple.

The newsletter can easily be set up. You can collect the email addresses and copy and paste them in 3 different formats into your favorite emailing service, or you can use our **easy-as-hell** to use *mailchimp* connection service.

*Mailchimp, the even easier way to send your mails*.

If you are sick of doing all the work manually, do it the mailchimp way. We integrated a kickass mailchimp integration that *does it all for you*. You only have to select a mailing list you want to add the users to. Now, if an interested user signs up for the newsletter, he will be directly entered in your mailchimp list! *It can’t be any easier*!

**On top of that**, we deliver a gorgeous mail template for mailchimp. You can import it and modify it in the mailchimp template composer. *Change the colors by pressing some buttons*! 

Not only a mailchimp template is included. If your users sign up to a newsletter, they will get a *confirmation mail* that looks just as amazing as the mailchimp template. The best part: You can edit the email template right in our **easy to use theme configuration panel**. 

*PayPal included*
We included a PayPal gateway, so you can sell your tickets with a few clicks. All you need is a PayPal business account or access to an api code, and you can earn money with your theme. Almost no configuration needed!<br>We also included the possibility to test the code with a sandbox api account first.
(The PayPal feature is disabled in the preview)

*Print out your list!*
There is no use for a guest list event template if you couldn’t print out the templates. Built into the theme configuration panel, you can directly print the guest lists and hand it over to your staff. Easy, clean, compact.

Once the event is over it will show disappear from the website. You can create a gorgeous **blog page** to show images and share information about your club, bar, event service…
