		<h3 id="disclaimer"><strong>Disclaimer</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>Although support is not required of ThemeForest authors, I do offer support for the theme and its core features and functionality. I cannot guarantee that this theme will function with all third-party components and plugins. Max Mag Theme is presented as is.</p>
