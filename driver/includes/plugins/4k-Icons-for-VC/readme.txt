Installation
============

Upload the main plugin zip file and the font icon packs found in the `plugin` folder to your WordPress site and activate them all.

Why do we have multiple zip files? It's because some web hosts will not allow uploading of files which are more than 2MB :)


Usage
=====

After you installed the plugin, new element type will be available in Visual Composer named "4k Icon". Detailed information on each field is provided within the element's edit window.


Important Note
==============

Remember that each font group you include in your site will have to load a `CSS` file and a `font` file. Try and limit your icon selection to 1-2 font groups per page / post so as not to strain your loading time too much.
